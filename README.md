# koyaanisqatsi-in-a-box

We've all been there before: you have a great piece of music and some cool video footage, and you'd like to figure out some way to cohesively make them fit together.

Until now, you've had to call up Philip Glass and suffer through his undeserved smugness in order to make a film, and worse yet, you had to give it a dumb name. But now there's **Koyaanisqatsi In A Box**.

## Background

`kib` is an application that performs a combination of analysis, DSP, and post-production to achieve synchronized video and audio tracks in a single container, even if the audio and video inputs are of different lengths. It does this all within the confines of FFmpeg, Vapoursynth, and the Matroska container.
